React-CheatsheetüöÄ
ReactJS is an open-source, component based front end library. React d developed by Facebook and it is a JS library. Using this library we can build highly engaging and fast single-page web applications.

Hello World in React
// Import React and ReactDOM
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
// Render component into the DOM - only once per app
ReactDOM.render(
 <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
 document.getElementById('root')
);
What is React Elements?
This React Elements are the smallest building blocks of React. This element describes what we want to see on the screen of our website.

<span>Title</span>
<div> lorem.....</div>
<button>button</button>
<h1>Headings</h1>
React elements is written by using a method called JSX. All the single-tag elements should be self-closing and must end with a forward slash / , ex- img tag :

<br />
<img src="pic.jpeg" />
<hr />
Attributes in React
JSX is totally JavaScript and JS uses a camelcase naming convention. Attribute example: we write class attribute as className in Reactjs.

<div className="section"></div>
Styling of elements in react
In react instead of using double quotes (‚Äú‚Äù), we use two sets of curly braces in case of inline styling.

<p style={{ fontSize: 34, margin: '0 auto auto 10px', textAlign: 'right', color:'red' }}> Paragraph Content</p>
What is Fragments in React?
We can use fragments in those conditions when we don‚Äôt want to wrap or there is no use to enclose our elements in a container element like a div. Symbol of fragment <></>:

function ComponentName() {
  return (
    <>
      <span>Title</span>
      </p>My paragraph Content</p>
    </>
  );
} 
Components in React
Every application which we will develop in React is made up of pieces that pieces is called components. This make the life of developer easy and also we can easily collaborate on github and divide the tasks in component.

There are 2 types of components currently in React: Class and Functional.

Class Component
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class ProductCard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>This is ProductCard </h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<ProductCard />, document.getElementById('root'));
Functional Component
function Navbar() {
  return (
     <div> Navbar Content</div>
  );
} 

function Footer() {
  return (
     <div> Footer Content</div>
  );
} 
Props in React
In this code sample we are passing a prop age from App to the Client component. we passed Props from the parent component to a child component.

function App() {
  return <Client age="Twenty" />
}

function Client(props) {
  return <h1>John age is {props.age}</h1>; // John age is Twenty
}
Children Props in React
When we pass Props by placing data between the opening and closing tags of a component then this way passed Props are placed on the children property.

function App() {
  return (
   <Client>
     <h1>Rohit age is Twenty</h1>
   </Client>
  );
}

function Client({ children }) {
  return children; // Rohit age is Twenty
}
Stateless React Component
const Headline = () => {
 return <h1>React Cheat Sheet</h1>
}
// Component that receives props
const Greetings = (props) => {
 return <p>You will love it {props.name}.</p>
}
// Component must only return ONE element (eg. DIV)
const Intro = () => {
 return (
 <div>
 <Headline />
 <p>Welcome to the React world!</p>
 <Greetings name=‚ÄùPetr‚Äù />
 </div>
 )
}
ReactDOM.render(
 <Intro />,
 document.getElementById('root')
);
Conditional rendering of elements and CSS class
render() {
 const {isLoggedIn, username} = this.state;
 return (
 <div className={`login ${isLoggedIn ? 'is-in'
: 'is-out'}`}>
 {
 !!isLoggedIn ?
 <p>Logged in as {username}.</p>
 :
 <p>Logged out.</p>
 }
 </div>
 )
}
Import multiple exports using braces
import React, {ComponentName} from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
class Hello extends ComponentName {
  ...
}
Lifecycle Methods in React
 componentWillMount() {
 // It will fires immediately before the initial render
 }
 componentDidMount() {
 // It will fires immediately after the initial render
 }
 componentWillReceiveProps() {
 // It will fires when component is receiving new props
 }
 shouldComponentUpdate() {
 // It will fires before rendering with new props or state
 }
 componentWillUpdate() {
 // It will fires immediately before rendering with new props or state
 }
 componentDidUpdate() {
 // It will fires immediately after rendering with new props or state
 }
 componentWillUnmount() {
 // It will fires immediately before component is unmounted from DOM (removed)
 }
Lists in React
We used Lists in React to display data in an orderly manner. When we have to create lists in react we must have to include a special string attribute called as "key".

We use map() function to take output of lists of React components. Function .map() allows us to loop over arrays of data and give use output JSX.

In this code sample we are outputting a list of Fruits using the Fruit component.

function Fruit() {

  const fruits = ["Mango", "Apple", "Orange"];
  return (
    <div>
      {fruits.map((fruitName) => (
        <Fruit key={fruitName} name={fruitName} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
 }
React Context
Method that is used to pass props from parent to child component just by storing that props in a store and then use that props from the store by child component called React Context . We are passing props only manually not actually at each level of the component tree.

When we have to use Context, we can import the createContext function from React.This context includes a Provider and a Consumer property.

import { createContext } from 'react';
const AgeContext = createContext('');
function App() {
 return (
   <AgeContext.Provider value="Twenty">
     <Body />
   <AgeContext.Provider>
 );
} 

function Body() {
 return <Info />;
} 

function Info() {
 return (
   <AgeContext.Consumer>
     {age => <h1>Age is {age}</h1>}
   </AgeContext.Consumer>
 );
}
React Hooks
We use React Hooks to be able to use all the features that were previously only available in class components of React. Additionally, we can also create our own custom hooks in React Hook for our custom functionality. Many React hooks were added to the core React library as well. We are going to cover the

Majorly 6 essential hooks that we should know atleast:

1.useState 2.useEffect 3.useRef 4.useContext 5.useCallback 6.useMemo

Local state: useState
Declare the state

const [name, setName] = useState("initial value")
Update the state

setName("new value ")
Lazy-initialize the state

const [value, setValue] = useState(
( ) => computevalue( )
)
A very understandable example of using useState is to increment a counter.

import { useState } from 'react';
function MyCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  function updateMyCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }
  return <button onClick={updateMyCount}>Count is: {count}</button>;
}
